    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <h3>The Mars Farming Project is based on providing a consistent food supply for crewed missions to Mars. 
      This is because space missions to Mars will take months, and it is not reasonable to supply that amount of food in one mission.</h3>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <h3> As a result, the Mars Colony Design Team plans to grow plants effectively in the harsh environment of Mars.
      This will make future missions more feasible because carrying seeds to grow plants is more efficient than packing a lot of food. 
              In response, the team constructed an acrylic vacuum chamber to grow plants in sub-atmospheric pressures.

    <h2>Goals</h2> 
    <h3>Altogether, the team is planning to present the work from the Mars Farming Project at the International Astronautical Congress in 2022, in Paris. 
      In that time, the team is researching and prototyping effective models.</h3>
